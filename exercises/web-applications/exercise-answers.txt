Exercise 1
1. What is the requested URL? https://www.google.com
2. Which version of HTTP is used? Version 1.1
3. Does the browser ask for a persistent or a non-persistent connection? Persistent, indicated by "Connection: keep-alive".
4. In your opinion, why would it be beneficial to indicate the type (and version) of browser used by
the client in the HTTP Request? 
A service can optimise their web content based on User Agent information. It can also help with troubleshooting problems or identifying compatiblity issues. 

Exercise 2 
Write down two feasible responses of the HTTP server (only the status line):
- HTTP/1.1 200 OK
- HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND

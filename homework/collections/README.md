The goal of this programming assignment is to practise working with:
- the [Java Collections Framework][2]
- and learn to distinguish working with interfaces and actual implementations

## :books: Java Collections

Implement all the methods of the [`CollectionsAssignment` class][3]. 
Each method has documentation that describes what it should do.

To verify that your code works as expected, run the `CollectionsAssignmentTest` tests.

In your terminal, ensure that you are in the `collections` homework folder.
Then run the following command in your terminal.

```shell
./mvnw clean test
```

If you are on Windows, run this command instead:

```shell
mvnw.cmd clean test
```
